### Hi there 👋
I'm **Shibin Judah Paul**, an Electronics and Communications engineer with a keen interest in Robotics and AI, in that order. My interest in AI mostly involves Computer Vision and Deep learning. I also love playing around with ML models with transfer learning, NLP models and perform EDA on Astronomical data (space image data) for fun. I am passionate about building intelligent systems that can perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. I believe that the fusion of these cutting-edge technologies has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the world around us.
