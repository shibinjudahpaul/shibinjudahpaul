### Hi there 👋
I'm **Shibin Judah Paul**, I have a **Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering** and also a keen interest in **Robotics and AI**, _in that order_. My interest in AI mostly involves **Computer Vision** and **Deep learning**. I also love playing around with **ML models with transfer learning**, **NLP models to generate Poetry** and **performing EDA on Astronomical data** (space image data) for **fun**.

I am **passionate** about building **intelligent systems** that can **perceive**, **reason**, and **act in complex environments**. I believe that the **fusion** of these cutting-edge technologies has the potential to **revolutionize** the way we interact with the world around us and **empower Humanity**.
